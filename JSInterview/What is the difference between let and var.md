### What is the difference between let and var

    You can list out the differences in a tabular format

    | var                                                   | let                         |
    | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
    | It is been available from the beginning of JavaScript | Introduced as part of ES6   |
    | It has function scope                                 | It has block scope          |
    | Variables will be hoisted                             | Hoisted but not initialized |

    Let's take an example to see the difference,

    ```javascript
    function userDetails(username) {
      if (username) {
        console.log(salary); // undefined due to hoisting
        console.log(age); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
        let age = 30;
        var salary = 10000;
      }
      console.log(salary); //10000 (accessible to due function scope)
      console.log(age); //error: age is not defined(due to block scope)
    }
    userDetails("John");
    ```
